        This example shows how to use Servlet REST to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the Rest DSL

        <br/>

        For Java DSL the routes are defined in Java code, in the <code>org.apache.camel.example.rest.RestRouteBuilder</code>
        class.
        
        <p/>
        There is a <i>provider</i> REST service that supports the following operations
        <ul>
            <li>GET /rest/provider/{id} - to view a provider with the given id</li>
            <li>GET /rest/provider/ - to view all providers</li>
            <li>PUT /provider - to update/create an provider</li>
        </ul>

        The view operations are HTTP GET, and update is using HTTP PUT.

        From a web browser you can access the first two services using the following links

        <ul>
            <li><a href="rest/provider/123">provider/123</a> - to view the provider with id 123</li>
            <li><a href="rest/provider/">provider/</a> - to list all providers</li>
        </ul>

        From the command shell you can use curl to access the service as shown below:
<pre>
    curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/providerservice/rest/provider/123
    curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/providerservice/rest/provider/findAll
    curl -X PUT -d "{ \"id\": 999, \"name\": \"Dr. Who\"}" -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/providerservice/rest/provider
</pre>

        Notice when trying to get provider with id 789 then there is a built-in delay of 0.5-2 seconds, to simulate some
        slowness in the service.

        <p/>
        This example offers an API browser using Swagger which is accessible from the following link
        <ul>
            <li><a href="api-docs">api-docs</a> - overview of the apis from the REST services</li>
            <li><a href="api-docs/provider">api-docs/provider</a> - api of the provider REST service</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
        To use the swagger ui, follow this link. Replace the URL value with this one to access the REST local resources (http://localhost:8080/api-docs or (http://localhost:8080/providerservice/api-docs
        when deployed in Apache Tomcat)
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">swagger</a> - swagger ui page</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
